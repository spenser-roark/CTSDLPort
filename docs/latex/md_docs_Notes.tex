\section*{class \hyperlink{classBackground}{Background} needs to include the width and height of the viewable bg}

\item Is this a good solution?
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item use the overlay/collision grid for each bg instead have a set w/h for it and if the camera hits the edge of that it should stop
\item Gonna need to have positions for that anyway might as well use it\textquotesingle{}s edges for the map collision
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item This is necessary for determining whether the camera is larger than the image?
\item Necessary if the bg changes in some way
