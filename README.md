# Scope
For right now all I want to do is make Crono's house. Possibly more to follow afterwards, but initially I just want to do that.

## Collission detection
  * Walls
  * Objects
  * Characters - only if we do more than just Crono's room
    * Special case here as we should be able to walk through a character after pushing for so long
    * doorways - same character

## Sprites
  * Furniture in Crono's room
  * Backgrounds
    * Are these included in the background or separate objects?
  * Cat - must have since it's there when crono wakes up
  * Mother - She wakes him up
  * The man himself

## Cutscene
  * Mother waking crono up
## Text
  * Mother waking crono up
  * Lucca convo in the kitchen - if we decide to do more than just Crono's room

## Loading zones
  * If we do the first floor of the house

## character customization, naming, identification
  * When mother asks for Lucca's name
    * Default name of Lucca
    * Can change that once and only once

## Character portrait images
  * Only playable characters now

## Triangle menu
  * All submenus
    * Items
    * Character stats
    * Saving
      * this doesn't need to work right now
    * config
      * Include screen size in that among other things

...

So much more to come holy crap
